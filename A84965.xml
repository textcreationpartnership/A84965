         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIr≈øt, That a Committee or Commi≈ø≈øioners be appointed by the Parliament to come downe, and abide at the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters of the Army, with full power and authority to Audite and State the Accounts thereof, and to give De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures, as well for the pay re≈øpited upon the Publique Faith, as otherwi≈øe for their ≈øervice under the command of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> or any other re≈øpective Command wherein they or any of them have formerly ≈øerved the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that ≈øo what ≈øhall appeare ju≈øtly due upon the ≈øaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures, may be made an unque≈øtionable Debt unto them: And for the more effectuall accompli≈øhment thereof, we de≈øire, that the re≈øpective Trea≈øurers and Commi≈ø≈øaries of Mu≈øters of the ≈øeverall Armies may be commanded to attend the ≈øaid Committee or Commi≈ø≈øioners; That thereby the Arreares of any per≈øon of this Army incurred in other Armies or Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, who by his or their continuall attendance upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, have not had their Accounts audited and ≈øtated, may now be fully accounted for, without further trouble. And for as much as the Accounts of many who are now Members of this Army, and have formerly ≈øerved the Parliament under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commands, through the neglect or want of Mu≈øters, lo≈ø≈øe of Papers, death of Officers, taking of Garri≈øons, &amp;c. and will be very difficult to be cleered, to what they will be for the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice under the command of his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> where Mu≈øters have been certaine and Accounts better kept,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160544:4"/>and ≈øuch contingencies as afore≈øaid have not happened. We humbly offer that the ≈øaid Committee or Commi≈ø≈øioners may have ≈øuch full In≈øtructions that where Certificates from ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Officers cannot po≈ø≈øibly be obtained, or other ≈øufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony had, the Oath of ≈øuch per≈øons may be taken, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid as to the ≈øtating of their Accounts. And in regard there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a di≈ø≈øatisfaction upon the Army, grounded upon the In≈øtructions made for the Auditing of our Accounts, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed at the Randezvouz of the Army, at <hi>Triploe-Heath</hi> in order to our ≈øatisfaction, wherein care is taken for the abatement for free Quarter, when Monies have been received, and Quarters not accordingly ≈øatisfied; but no notice taken of payment of Quarters at any time beyond our proportions of pay received, or any regard had of the ≈øeverall hard≈øhips, wants and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we have been put upon in times of eminent Services, <hi>viz.</hi> difficult Marches, continuall Motions, and tedious Leaguers, &amp;c. whereby the greatne≈ø≈øe of our Body, or clo≈øene≈ø≈øe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture in quartering, there hath been ≈øuch ≈øcarcity in Provi≈øion, that both Officers and Souldiers have been put to extreame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in procuring nece≈ø≈øaries to live upon; and all this at ≈øuch time when no Monies have been ≈øent us, and hereupon proceede made to the ≈øeverall large deductions thereafter ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, which we neither then, nor yet can ≈øee good grounds for. We humbly offer, That the two Houles will be plea≈øed to rea≈ø≈øume the Con≈øideration of the ≈øaid In≈øtructions, and thinke upon ≈øome expedient whereby our Deductions for free Quarter may be moderated, as to the In≈øtructions afore≈øaid; and that no per≈øon who hath con≈øtantly paid Quarters may be put upon any Deduction, or any Officer be accountable for any thing, ≈øave that which particularly concernes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>And fursher, we de≈øire there may be effectuall cour≈øe and provi≈øion made for the ≈øtating the Accompts, and ≈øecuring the Arrears of tho≈øe the Souldiers of the Kingdom, who have faithfully ≈øerved the Kingdom and concurred with this Army in their late Engagement.</p>
            <p>That whereas divers of the Hor≈øemen of this Army, upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160544:4"/>the lo≈ø≈øe of their Hor≈øes in the Parliaments Service, have at their own charge furni≈øhed them≈øelves with others for the ≈øaid Service, and happily have again lo≈øt certain of the ≈øaid Hor≈øes ≈øo bought, whereby the State hath been ≈øerved, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers much damnified, We humbly de≈øire the two Hou≈øes will be plea≈øed to take it into their con≈øideration, that ≈øome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ≈øatisfaction may be thought upon for ≈øuch as by ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient te≈øtimoniall ≈øhall make it appear they have been damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as afore≈øaid.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That provi≈øion may be forthwith made, and a vi≈øible ≈øecurity given to ≈øatisfie the Arrears of the Army, in ≈øuch way and manner as may be lea≈øt burthen≈øom to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth; in order to which we offer, That Bi≈øhops lands, Deanes and Chapters lands, and Forre≈øt-lands, may be ≈øpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øet to Sale, or otherwi≈øe made over for the u≈øe afore≈øaid, or any other way the Parliament in their wi≈øedomes ≈øhall think meet appearing ≈øatisfaction for the ≈øecurity of the ≈øaid Army.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That there may be an Ordinance for ≈øecuring all and every per≈øon in this Army, who have willingly ≈øerved the Parliament, from being impre≈øted out of this Kingdom to any forreign Service, and that no Hor≈øeman ≈øhall be forced to ≈øerve on Foot in any future Ca≈øe; and for the more reall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting hereof, we de≈øire, every ≈øuch per≈øon as afore≈øaid as ≈øhall have a Certificate under the Generalls, or his re≈øpective Field-Officers or Captains hand, that he hath ≈øerved in this Army, which he may carry about him or keep by him, or producing ≈øuch a Ticket he may be di≈øcharged, and that if any Officer ≈øhall detain any ≈øuch per≈øon after the ≈øight of ≈øuch te≈øtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, there may be a certain penaltie inflicted upon him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Ordinances concerning Apprentices Freedom that have ≈øerved the Parliament, may be made an Act before or at the ≈øetling of a Peace.</p>
